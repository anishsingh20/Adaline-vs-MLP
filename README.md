# Adaline-vs-MLP
A project to implement,analyze and compare Perceptron network with Adaline(adaptive Linear neuron) network and MLP(Multi layer perceptron) in R on Iris dataset.

File __MLP.R__ contains the implementation of multi layer perceptron on iris dataset. File __perceptron.R__ contains the implementation of linear perceptron network in R.
File __adalineSGD.R__ consists of the implementation of Adaline network in R.

Amongst the 3 algorithms best performance was by MLP and adaline. Perceptron network had least accuracy amongst the three.

For visualizations and plotting I have used the __'highcharter'__ package in R which has syntax similar to __ggplot2__.

Below is the plot of comparison of MLP with perceptron network.
